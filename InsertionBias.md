# Insertion Bias

**Motivation**: 
P-element has strong insertion bias into piRNA clusters; why would TE be so stupid? Maybe it is an advantage because it reduces the burden of TEs; while at the same time not limiting the chances of a TE of invading a new population (Probability of Establishment).

- [ ] Fig4: fitness effect of insertion bias; insertion biases reduce the fitness burden of TEs; but is this reduction of fitness burden sufficient to promote TEs with an insertion bias.

- [ ] Fig5: simulation-storm; competition among TEs with a different insertion bias, which one wins; a) normal genome (5chromosomes pirna cluster) b) one chromosome one cluster no recombination c) clonal; hence insertion bias always wins; only advantage when clonal.

- [ ] Fig6: possibly simulation with selective cluster insertions; show how insertion bias gradually wins (not sure if necessary)

- [ ] Fig7: simulation-storm; consequences of insertion bias against pirna clusters: extinction; many more extinct populations,

- [ ] Fig8: discussion: why do we not see more extinctions? maybe the TE can't control it; maybe other mechanisms; why does the p-element have the shitty bias than?

- [ ] Fig 1; Fitness after invasion; shotgun phase with different insertion bias

- [ ] Fig 2; direction competition; no insertion bias vs insertion bias. Who wins?

- [ ] Fig 3; probability of establishment is not affected

- [ ] Fig 4; properties of TE invasions with insertion bias - shorter phase length - fewer TEs - more cluster insertions
