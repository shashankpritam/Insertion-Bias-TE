## Introduction

In this simulation we explore the question - How does a species adapt to
Transposable Element (TE) invasion across dynamic population sizes due
to annual cycles and geographical variations?

## Materials & Methods

version: invadego0.1.3

### Commands for the simulation

The simulations were generated using the code from:

- [sim_storm.py](./Simulation-Results_Files/simulation_storm/minfit/sim_storm.py)

### Parameters

Simulations were ran with the following parameters:

- Number of simulations: 10000
- Number of threads: 4
- Number of replications (–rep): 1
- Transposition rate (–u): 0.2
- Number of steps (–steps): 5000
- Population size (–N): Variable
- Number of generations (–gen): 5000
- Negative effect of a TE insertion (–x): 0.01
- Genome (–genome) mb:10,10,10,10,10
- Recombination Rate (–rr): 4,4,4,4,4
- Negative effect of a cluster insertions (-no-x-cluins, i.e, x=0)
- Silent mode: True

Random Clusters were Generated using this snippet:

``` python
def get_rand_clusters(): 
    lower_limit = 0  # Lower bound
    upper_limit = math.log10(1e+7)  # Upper bound
    r = math.floor(10**random.uniform(lower_limit, upper_limit))
    return f"{r},{r},{r},{r},{r}"
```
